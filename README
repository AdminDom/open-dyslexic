font to help readability, and help dyslexic readability.

Rules:
- similar letters must look different
- make the letters have some weight to them.
- Try not to look like a handwritten or comic sans font. To some extent, this may be unavoidable, but differing degrees of readability can be a trade-off
- Intent to be used as 'the' on screen UI font is in my head also.
