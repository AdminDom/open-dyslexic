Download latest version of the font by clicking the TTF in the tree, and view it RAW. 

See what it looks like in the screenshots or http://abbiecod.es

font to help readability, and help dyslexic readability.

Rules:
- similar letters must look different
- make the letters have some weight to them.
- Try not to look like a handwritten or comic sans font. To some extent, this may be unavoidable, but differing degrees of readability can be a trade-off
- Intent to be used as 'the' on screen UI font is in my head also.
I am not posting a seperate version of it in the downloads section again until version 1.0.


It is based on Bitstream Vera Sans because of the nice license it has. 

If you are looking for the source file, it is the .ttf file. Also, I am not packaging this as an EXE file. 
DO NOT DOWNLOAD AS AN INSTALLER. You will likely get spyware. :( Fonts101 is packaging this in an exe that may contain spyware. I don't know if anyone else is.
