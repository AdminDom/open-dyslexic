          <h3>OpenDyslexic</h3>
<p>*Sandy trashed my website. This is temporary*</p>
        <p style="clear:both;">OpenDyslexic is a new open sourced font created to increase readability
            for readers with dyslexia. The typeface includes regular, bold, italic and bold-italic styles. It is being updated continually and improved
            based on input from dyslexic users. There are no restrictions on using
            OpenDyslexic outside of attribution.</p>
         <p>Your brain can sometimes do funny things to letters. OpenDyslexic tries to help prevent some of these things from happening. Letters have heavy weighted bottoms to add a kind of "gravity" to each letter, helping to keep your brain from rotating them around in ways that can make them look like other letters. Consistently weighted bottoms can also help reinforce the line of text. The unique shapes of each letter can help prevent flipping and swapping.</p>
         <p>OpenDyslexic also takes a different approach to italic styles. It is generally recommended that italics be avoided in reading material for dyslexia. However, instead of taking the normal approach of "slant x% for italic," OpenDyslexic's italic style has been crafted to allow for its use for <i>emphasis</i> while maintaining readability.</p>
